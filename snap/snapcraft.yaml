summary: Tiny static web server with TLS and HTTP/2 support
description: |
  Static web server using the builtin Go http library.

  It supports HTTP/2 and TLS.

  This snap provides both an `h2static` command that can be run by any user,
  with access to the user home directory, and a system-wide daemon.

  The daemon is configured with the following options:

  * `basic-auth`

    content of the crednetials file for Basic Authorization. Each line should contain
    colon-separated pair of username and SHA512 hash of the password.

  * `disable-h2`

    set to true to disable HTTP/2 support.

  * `disable-lookup-with-suffix`

    set to true to disable disable matching files with .htm(l) suffix for paths
    without suffix.

  * `listen`

    the `address:port` for the service to listen on. The address can be omitted
    (e.g. `:8080`) to bind all addresses.

    If this option empty or null, the service will not be started.

  * `serve-path`

    the directory to serve content from. it's set to `$SNAP_COMMON` if not
    specified.

    If the `removable-media` interface is connected, paths under `/media` can
    also be used.

  * `show-dotfiles`

    set to true to show hidden files (starting with a dot).

  * `tls.cert`, `tls.key`

    ASCII contents of the TLS certificate and key. If both are set, HTTPS
    support will be enabled.
