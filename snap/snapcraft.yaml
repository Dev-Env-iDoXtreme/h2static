summary: Tiny static web server with TLS and HTTP/2 support
description: |
  Static web server using the builtin Go http library.

  It supports HTTP/2 and TLS.

  This snap provides both an command "h2static" that can be run by any user,
  with access to the user home directory, and a system-wide daemon.

  The daemon is configured with the following options:

    - listen

      the "address:port" for the service to listen on. The address can be
      omitted (e.g. :8080) to bind all addresses.

      If this option is not set, the service will not be started.

    - serve-path

      the directory to serve content from. it's set to $SNAP_COMMON if not
      specified.

      If the "removable-media" interface is connected, a path under /media can
      also be used.

    - disable-h2

      set to true to disable HTTP/2 support.

    - tls.cert, tls.key

      ASCII content of the TLS certificate. If both are set, HTTPS support will
      be enabled.
